# D3-Challenge
This assignment involves using D3 to visualize medical demographic data on a webpage.

This app can be launched using LiveServer, and displays a default scatterplot of the dataset with "Healthcare (%)" on the Y-Axis and "Median Age" on the X-Axis.

When you hover over the datapoints, a tooltip appears that shows the exact data for the state (you can locate each state using it's two-letter abbreviation).

You can select a different dataset by clicking on the other options for X-Axis and Y-Axis, and the scatterplot rescales and shifts points to display the new data. The tooltip information also updates.

The rest of the page is sample text you could use for an analysis of the various scatterplots.
